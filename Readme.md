### **1. Project Title**

**Decentralized Meme NFTs**

---

### **2. Project Description**

Decentralized Meme NFTs is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to mint and own unique memes as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Stacks blockchain.
Each meme is linked to a permanent metadata URI (image or video) stored in decentralized storage, ensuring memes remain immutable, ownable, and tradeable forever.

### **3. Project Vision**

To create the ultimate decentralized meme economy where internet culture meets blockchain ownership.
We aim to make memes eternal digital collectibles, empowering creators to profit from their humor and creativity while preserving meme history.

---

### **4. Future Scope**

* **Marketplace Integration** – Enable buying, selling, and trading memes directly on-chain.
* **Creator Royalties** – Implement royalty fees for meme creators on resale.
* **Community Voting** – Allow token holders to vote for the "Meme of the Month."
* **Meme Tournaments** – Blockchain-based meme competitions with NFT prizes.
* **AR/VR Meme Galleries** – Showcase memes in the metaverse.

### **5. Contract Address**

*(Replace this with the deployed contract address once on the Stacks blockchain)*
`SPXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.meme-nft`

---

If you want, I can also **extend this contract** to include a **marketplace function** or **royalty system** so meme creators earn on every resale. That would make the project more powerful.

Do you want me to prepare **that upgraded version** next?
